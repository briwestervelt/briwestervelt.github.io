        <h3>Hands-on</h3>
        <p>
          Clinic courses are courses unique to Rowan University which allow engineering students to get
          immediate hands-on industry experience.
          These are usually general engineering courses which teach core concepts
          and almost always involve hands-con projects.
          Rowan engineers take one clinic course each semester,
          for a total of eight clinics.
        </p>
        <h3>Freshman/Sophomore Clinic</h3>
        <p>
          The first four clinics each have a set of criteria that professors must teach.
          The other content and assignments are generally the choice of the professor.
          Criteria for the first four semesters is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            General engineering information, such as significant figures
          </li>
          <li>
            Engineering statistics with a strong emphasis on statistical error
          </li>
          <li>
            Technical Writing
          </li>
          <li>
            Public Speaking
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Junior/Senior Clinic</h3>
        <p>
          The final four clinics are completed in small teams.
          There are hundreds of available projects supervised by
          various professors, local businesses, and industry professionals.
          This is where engineers at Rowan University get their most valuable
          hands-on experience, working side by side with those already in the field.
