This is one course in a sequence of courses that will provide a meaningful research and design experience for a team of undergraduate students under the direction of an engineering faculty advisor. The research topic will be chosen by mutual agreement of the undergraduate students and their advisor. The sequence will include a thorough literature search and review, the development of a clear and concise problem statement, consultations with other faculty and professional experts, and the derivation of publishable results. The research will culminate in a final written report and oral presentation.
