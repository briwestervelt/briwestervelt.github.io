This course begins with applications of integration (such as volume of a solid of revolution work, arc length, area of a surface of revolution, center of mass) and derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions. Integration by parts, partial fractions and other more advanced integration techniques are introduced, along with a discussion of numerical integration, improper integrals, indeterminate form, sequences and infinite series. A graphing calculator is required for this course, and so is the use of computer software, such as Mathematica.
