The field of electrical and computer engineering is very diverse and is growing exponentially. This course is designed to serve as a feedback and feed-forward mechanism not only to reinforce certain topics previously discussed elsewhere in the curriculum, but also to introduce new and/or emerging topics that are not covered elsewhere in the curriculum. The course is taught as a series of modules covering topics that are not part of any particular course, (e.g., power systems, smart power grid), topics to be reinforced, (engineering probability and statistics, random signals, transform techniques), and emerging topics that are not yet fully integrated into the curriculum. Therefore, different offerings of this course will likely have different topical content, chosen based on the feedback of the faculty and students during curriculum assessment, as well as important emerging topics that push the boundaries of electrical and computer engineering.
