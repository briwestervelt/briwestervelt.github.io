This class is concerned with processing of digital and/or discrete time signals using linear time invariant systems, hence digital signal processing - DSP. It is DSP that makes communication systems, medical diagnosis and monitoring systems, engine diagnostics, seismic/tectonic/oceanographic analysis systems, all of audio-visual entertainment systems and many other countless systems possible. This course has been designed to deepen the real-world perspective at the forefront in each topic discussed, without sacrificing any of the elegant mathematics that underlies all DSP techniques. The primary goals of this course are to (1) introduce time and frequency domain concepts and the associated mathematical tools that are fundamental to all DSP techniques; and (2) provide a thorough understanding and working knowledge of design, implementation, analysis and comparison of digital filters for processing of discrete time signals. The class will discuss the following topics: representation of signals and systems in time and frequency domains, the z-transform, filter structures, filter design and implementation, random signal analysis and spectral estimation, finite wordlength effects and wavelet tranforms for time-frequency analysis.
