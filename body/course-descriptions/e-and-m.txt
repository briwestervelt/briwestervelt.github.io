This course studies the basic principles of electricity and magnetism and is equivalant to most calculus based introductory electricity and megnetism courses often entitled Physics II. The course is designed to cover introductory electricity and megnetism (charge, current, potential, fields, AC and DC circuits, Maxwell's Equations, and electromagnetic waves) at a level appropriate for future scientists and engineers. The course includes a laboratory component and it emphasizes problem-solving techniques.
