With more Embedded systems being sold each year, the demand for Engineers who understand these systems is ever increasing. This course introduces students to microprocessors and microcontrollers from instruction sets and architecture to peripherals and software. Several processor architectures and instruction sets are briefly covered as well as assembly language;however, the majority of the course focuses on embedded software. At the end of this course students will be able to develop embedded systems to solve real design problems. The focus of this course will be on using embedded peripherals (analog to digital converters, communications, timers, interrupts, PWM, etc.). Students will work hand on with their own embedded systems from the beginning of the course and will learn how to design basic embedded systems using modern integrated development environments. There will be a strong emphasis on project based learning and each student will be required to make a significant contribution to a final project.
