This course studies the basic principles or mechanics and is equivalent to most calculus based introductory mechanics courses often entitled Physics I. The course is designed to cover introductory mechanics. (Newton's laws, energy and momentum conservation, rotating systems, statics, gravity and simple harmonic motion) at a level appropriate for future scientists and engineers. The course includes a laboratory component and it emphasizes problem-solving techniques.
