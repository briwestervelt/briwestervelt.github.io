This is an interdisciplinary course which will fulfill a Humanities/Languages General Education course. It introduces the student to significant primary texts, taken from literature, philosophy, religion, and history, within the Western and non-Western traditions and provides a common base of cultural literacy. Emphasis is placed on critical thinking and the qualitative evaluation of human experience.
