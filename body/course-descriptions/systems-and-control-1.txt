The first course in control systems introduces the fundamental concepts of linearity, time-invariance, stability and the transfer function. Mathematical and circuit equivalence of different systems (electrical, mechanical, fluidic, and thermal) are established. A thorough treatment of stability through the Routh-Hurwitz, root locus and Nyquist criterion is given. Frequency response analysis by means of the Bode plot is also covered. Software simulation primarily with MATLAB and laboratory experiments will complement and supplement the theory.
