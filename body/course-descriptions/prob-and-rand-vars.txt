This course is an introduction to the theory and application of probability and random variables, with a short introduction to mathematical statistics, as the post-calculus level. Topics covered include sample spaces, random variables, discrete and continuous probability distributions, mathematical expectation, and multivariate distributions. At the end of the course the concept of estimation, from mathematical statistics, will be introduced. A few of the concepts of descriptive statistics will be introduced as needed. Use of a graphing calculator is required.
