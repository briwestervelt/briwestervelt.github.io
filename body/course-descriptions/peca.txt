The fundamental principles of circuit and network theory constitute the very foundation on which the field of electrical engineering stands. From a simple household item such as a toaster or flashlight, to the most advanced devices, large scale electric power distribution and transmission systems, including such emerging topics as smart grid, photovoltaic energy generation to electric vehicle technology, all operate based on the basic concepts of circuit and network theory. This core course, which constitutes the primary prerequisite of most other ECE courses, is designed to provide the students not only with a comprehensive foundation of circuit and network theory, but also the basic skills of circuit analysis, design and testing. Starting with Ohm's Law, this course first discusses resistive and DC circuits and introduces Kirchhoff's Laws, Thevenin and Norton equivalents of networks, mesh and nodal analysis, followed by independent and dependent sources, and operational amplifiers. The second haalf of the course focuses on AC circuits and memristors. Laplace transforms will be introduced for transient and steady state response of networks, followed by various applications of AC circuits, such as filters. Computer-aided analysis and simulation tools are also presented as contemporary methods of network analysis and design.
