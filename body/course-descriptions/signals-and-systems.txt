Continuous and descrete systems are used in every branch of engineering. Communication systems (for the transmission of voice, video and data), robotic systems, energy systems, biometric systems (Identification of a person based on physiological traits), systems that aid the handicapped and system-on-chip circuits are just a few examples that use the fundamental principles taught in this course. This course provides students with a foundation in linear dynamical systems and provides the appropriate background to engage in more advanced subjects like controls, signal processing and communications. This course will discuss the fundamental tools associated with the analysis of continuous (Laplace transform, Fourier transform and Fourier series) and discrete (z-transform) signals and systems. The concepts of impulse response, frequency response, convolution are taught with the appropriate background in complex numbers and variables. Simple analog and digital filters and their practical uses form a major component of the laboratory component.
