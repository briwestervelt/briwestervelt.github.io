This course introduces Electrical and Computer Engineering students to basic concepts in statics, dynamics and the thermal/fluid sciences. Special emphasis is placed upon the design and analysis of systems relevant to electrical engineers including actuators, motors and other electromechanical devices. Heat generation and removal from electronic devices will also be given significant coverage.
